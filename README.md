# Data Scientist Task

As a Data Scientist, my primary responsibilities include:

## Flask Web Application Development:

- Developing a Flask web application that visualizes insights from an e-commerce dataset.
- Implementing two routes: /dashboard for relevant visualizations and /data for displaying raw data.
- Utilizing a data visualization library (e.g., Plotly, Matplotlib) to create informative and visually appealing charts.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python & SQL:

- Performing exploratory data analysis on the e-commerce dataset.
- Leveraging Python (version 3.9.16) for statistical analysis and insights generation.
- Utilizing SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the dataset stored in a MySQL database (version 8.0.35).
- Creating visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks for in-depth exploration.

## Power BI Visualizations
- Load the data from the created database with the appropriate connector.
- Build a data model for the extracted data.
- Design a Power BI dashboard that provides meaningful insights from the data.
- Utilize appropriate visualizations (charts, graphs, etc.).
- Submit the Power BI file along with a brief explanation of your design choices.

## Documentation:

- Providing clear and concise documentation for the Flask web application.
- Describing how to run the Flask application locally.
- Outlining the steps for running tests on the Flask app.
- Documenting the process of conducting exploratory data analysis using Python and SQL.

## Code Quality and Best Practices:

- Ensuring well-structured, modular, and best-practice-following code for the Flask application.
- Implementing error handling for a graceful user experience.
- Maintaining clarity and readability in code for ease of understanding and collaboration.

## Bonus (Optional):

- Implementing user authentication for accessing the /dashboard route.
- Dockerizing the Flask application for ease of deployment.
